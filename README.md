# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
## Objective
To design and develop an interactive and user-friendly Tic Tac Toe game using Java Swing that supports two players, tracks turns, checks win/tie conditions, and provides a reset functionality.

## Features
- Developed using Java Swing for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- Implements two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O).
- Displays current player's turn dynamically.
- Automatically checks for:
Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins
Tie condition when all tiles are filled without a winner
Color-coded visual feedback:
Winning tiles turn green
Tie condition shows pink tiles
- Includes a Restart button to reset the game board and play again without restarting the app.
- Ensures players cannot override already-filled tiles.

## Technologies Used
- Java Programming Language
- Java Swing for GUI (JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JButton)
- AWT for layout and event handling (ActionListener)
- 2D Arrays to manage the game board (JButton[][])
- OOP Concepts â€“ Encapsulation, Objects, Classes
- Event-driven programming to respond to user actions
- Font and Color APIs for styling game components
